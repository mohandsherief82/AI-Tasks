1. Linear regression model:
   * I tried using a linear regression model with a combination of L1 and L2 regularization using Elasticnet.
2. SVM:
   * I also tried a linear SVM model with L2 regularization  using LinearSVC.
3. RandomFoerst:
   * A random forest with 100 estimators.
4. Ensemble model:
   * Finally, i used the random forest and the linear regression model together in an ensembled model.
